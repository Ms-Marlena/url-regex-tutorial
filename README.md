## Summary

A regex (short for "regular expression") is a pattern written in a specific way to assist with searching for text that follows a certain pattern or format. In addition to searches, regexes provide a way to verify whether user entries on a web page are formatted correctly, or contain the correct composition of characters.

This regex can be used to match a URL within a document. I will describe the parts of the regex, as seen below in the table of contents. The user will be able to search for any text that matches the pattern of a URL.
